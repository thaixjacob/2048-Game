# 2048 Game

This is a personal project to create the game 2048 using HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

## How to Play

The objective of the game is to slide numbered tiles on a grid to combine them to create a tile with the number 2048. Each turn, a new tile will appear with a value of either 2 or 4. You can slide the tiles up, down, left or right. If two tiles with the same number collide during the slide, they will merge into a tile with the sum of their values.

## Installation and Usage

Clone the repository and open the index.html file in your browser to start the game.

`git clone https://github.com/your-username/2048-game.git`

`cd 2048-game`
